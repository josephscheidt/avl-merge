# avl-merge

A Java program to build and merge AVL binary trees efficiently

As part of an algorithms course at Johns Hopkins University, one of our programming assigments was to implement self-balancing AVL trees and come up with a way to merge two trees of depth m and n in the minimim possible of O(m+n), O(n lg m), or O(m lg n) time. We were to discover the most efficient algorithm on our own.

This repository contains the Java code files from my implementation of AVL trees in Java, along with the merge algorithm I came up with (which proved to be the correct one), and the accompanying report.
